# 🚀 Smart Research Engine  
### _A Modern Gen-AI Powered RAG System for Smart Document & Web Research_

Smart Research Engine is a fully modular, production-ready **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system designed for intelligent research across PDFs, and multiple websites.  
Built with **LangChain**, **ChromaDB**, and **state-of-the-art embedding models**, this engine delivers high-accuracy retrieval and intelligent AI-generated insights through a clean Streamlit interface.
